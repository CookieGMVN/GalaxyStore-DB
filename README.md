# GalaxyStore-DB
A repository that includes all the things on the Tizen Galaxy Store.

# Why?
Since Samsung has alerted the public recently that the Tizen service will be terminated as of September 30, 2025, which means after that date, you will no longer be able to download applications and watch faces for Tizen products anymore.

So, with [this](https://xdaforums.com/t/root-required-how-to-extract-gear-s3-watch-faces-and-apps-from-the-galaxy-store.4687851/) and [this](https://shad0w82.github.io/Tizen_Watch_App_DB/), I have decided to save all the apps on the Galaxy Store as many as possible.

# How to install the apps on my watch?
It's quite easy, and you can follow the tutorial [here](https://xdaforums.com/t/howto-sign-and-sideload-tizen-applications-to-the-gear-fit2-from-windows.3639793/).

# How can I contribute to the project?
The project is already active on [XDA Forum](https://xdaforums.com/t/root-required-how-to-extract-gear-s3-watch-faces-and-apps-from-the-galaxy-store.4687851/). However, I want to run a website that will be easier for you to find the apps that you like with a search engine included.

To contribute to the project, you need to fork this repository, then upload the file in the exact following directory structure:
```
|- <APP NAME>
|  \information.json
|  \file.tpk or file.wgt
```
